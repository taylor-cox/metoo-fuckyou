# Spring Boot, Motherfucker.
Want to hear some crazy shit?

This is my best rendition of a sober recount of the past 2 years of my life. 

I'm posting it online, directly to my GitHub, because fuck it and fuck you.

It's going to be a fun trip down memory lane. Let's start.

Note: I was motivated by my ex hinting towards coming out with all this shit for her #metoo moment a few years too late. She never said it explicitly, but ya know. She had no problem telling my last gay boss man about at least *some* of this shit to try and get me in his pants (I *think*). Gross. I'd rather be raped in a cell.

Note 2: Whenever I go into something I'm not to sure of, I'm going to *put tin foil hat on* so you know not to take it too seriously.

Also, a good 90% of this shit is a gut feeling more real based-in-truth fact driven evidence.

Take it with a grain of salt.

Enjoy.

## Spring/Summer, 2022. The WPI "Masters" Experience.
The story might start before this depending on who you ask, but this is the most interesting part of everything from my perspective. I'd be *so* willing to talk about all my fuck ups more, so feel free to ask me to have a chat! (no thanks).

Let's start here.

---

### Part 1: Interesting Developments.
I try to kill myself, because I scammed my way into my masters at the behest of my old boss PHD man who (I believe) thought I was a massive racist. Why? 

I posted some shit on the internet, ending it with something along the lines of "Dang, you caught me, I hate black people", sarcastically. Much to my suprise, people actually started *believing* I hate black people. I can understand the confusion.

I digress.

This whole time, I'm being blackmailed by my boss to work harder or else my little secret might get out about the whole racist thing.

In EdTech, as it turns out, we call this a "learning experience".

A little bit after I start my Masters, who conveniently shows up in my life but a staggeringly âœ¨averageâœ¨  self-proclaimed "sex-addicted" PHD student who wanted to fuck me after her ex said to stay away from me.

In the wild west of Worcester, as an at *most* 6/10, we seize these opportunities.

Sue me.

I go to the hospital, because said bitch didn't think I realized her shit smelled *sussy wussy* (ðŸ¤®). It was pretty fucking stressful, what are ya gonna do.

It was a good time. As it turns out, not having the stress of a crazy blonde woman and an egomaniac blackmailing boss who thinks I'm racist weighing on you tends to make life a whole lot easier. They put me on bipolar medication because the instant I got there I felt way better, and a good sign of bipolar is swinging from high to low. They didn't put that on my report. I feel a little slighted by that. The medication speaks for itself I guess.

If you see me say that I am "way bipolar" or whatever, this is what I'm refering to.

So, I leave, and we go back to the grind. But I still don't *want* to be working on my Masters, not like my friends, family, or really anyone else in my life has ever or will ever give 2 flying fucks about what I want. In addition, I was already in the mess I guess so fuck it right? Here we are.

- As a side note, if you took the time to push me into my Masters, kindly go fuck yourself and have enough humility to admit you were *so incredibly* wrong.

- I was definitely wrong. Listening to you as opposed to my gut was an awful decision. I'm sorry. (did you catch the little slight of hand I did there?)

In short, fuck you. Look at how far your trust fund got you.

Anyway.

I grow attached to the blonde bitch. Maybe, I was too hard on her? Maybe, I was in the wrong? Maybe, this wasn't some tin-foil hat conspiracy theory plot by the tight-knit community of PHD students at WPI to ruin my life? Maybe, I was the crazy one?

---

### Part 2: I'm Sorry, What the Fuck?

Around this time, blonde PHD bitch I'm canoodling with sends me this.

<img src="what_the_fuck.jpeg" height=500>

She happens to have a camera pointed at the bed we're fucking in.

Ok.

She tells me in person that her ex has access to said camera.

Ok.

She sends me a photo showing the camera angle of the bed we are fucking in.

Ok.

She starts asking me really personal questions in that bed.

Ok.

She starts hinting towards her thinking I'm a *pedophile*.

Ok.

...

Wait, what the fuck?

"Learning Experience".

To be fair I never came with her. TMI, whatever, if you're reading this you want TMI anyway, go fuck yourself, see you in hell.

Anywhoosies.

Don't worry, I'll add all the texts and Snapchats and such between us to this repo for the world to have and enjoy, formulate your own opinions and such, as well as all the weird somewhat relevant playlists that have been made throughout this entire thing (at least the ones I still have access to, *put tin foil hat on* I'm sure someone else screenshotted mine for your enjoyment on the off chance I would accept my fate and be blackmailed into submission for the rest of my life. As it turns out, it's not going to happen you slimey egalitarian fucks ðŸ™‚).

Open source software is great.

As a side note, I'm pretty sure at some point the PHD bitch is going to petal that she got abused by me. Emotionally, sure, but physically, no. I was having a hard time trying to convince people that I wasn't crazy after I left a fucking insane asylum, so ya know. I was in the wrong. She wanted a dick appointment (I think, at this point who fucking knows). And quite frankly, fuck it and fuck you.

I think I technically harassed her at some point, so there's that. It's a bad habit. If I could go back and change giving her a slight amount of emotional distress... nah lol go fuck yourself. 

Proceeding swiftly forward.

She was into some really kinky sex. I obliged, being the good little 6/10 I should've been. My general sentiment at the time of said kinky sex will support this. In addition, I'm positive somewhere locked away in a Snapchat vault there's a kink test we took that supports my claims, which is probably why she's having so much trouble actually coming out with her #metoo story.

So, no. I never hit her or did anything to her outside the bounds of consent. Looking back on it now, I ***really*** wish I did. Fuck PHD bitch.

With that being said.

I guess I did fist her which she wasn't too fond of, but we had a safe word at that point so if there was anything that we were doing she wasn't comfortable with she could've just said something.

"No", would actually be the term that I would use.

"No" is a little hard to say when you're doing consentual-non-consent. Whatever the fuck that clusterfuck of words means to any of you.

Safe word!

Personally, looking back at what I've been through, *put tin foil hat on* I think she was being blackmailed, and if so, I would like to thank the PHD students of WPI or whoever put her up to that shit for giving me my own personal anal and very fistable sex slave.

Crazy shit.

Marching along.

---

### Part 3: End of Summer.
I start growing attached to the crazy blonde bitch. As it turns out, even though she was very insane (takes one to know one), the sex was very good. I liked her. It was insanely toxic and I loved it. Oh well, ya know she was some 2 or 3 years older than me, so I figure she knows what she's doing, right? She wouldn't fuck me over after all the time, effort and blackmail against me I gave her, right? We might be able to reach a common ground of decency and respect of one another, past all the bs that we went through, right? She was an insanely smart PHD student, she could help me and I could help her, right? I was the crazy one for seeing she was filming me in bed and sticking around, right?

Yikes. Let's take a break.

I wasn't a very good Masters student. I didn't like the classes I was taking, I had to manage people which I had no idea how to do, my boss gave no significant input throughout the entire process (which I guess is because he thought I hated him based on his skin color or some other bullshit), I was underpaid and overworked, etc etc. Classic Masters bullshit they make you do with the promise that you'll be paid more later. It sounds like, oh, I don't know, *a fucking scam*.

Finally, after some time of taking all this medication, having people treat me like a fucking messiah god programmer which was undeserved and unwarranted (but did a good deal to boost my ego I'll admit), and dealing with the most psycho blonde PHD bitch that I've ever met, it finally reaches a breaking point. I stop going to classes, stop working, and am waiting to be fired. It never happened. 

This is where it starts to get interesting.

---

### Part 4: The End.
Blond PHD bitch, after I stop working (to the suprise of nobody), fucks my best friend (I'm not *100% sure*, so lets just put a little allegedly in this sob). I'm 99% sure she did it on purpose, tumultuous relationshit and such to get me out of her life, or to just emotionally damage me beyond repair for her own / someone elses amusement, or maybe for some other reason. I don't know nor care enough at this point to figure it out. No offense taken, but "this isn't working out, fuck you" or "i'm fucking your bff get out of my life" or "you're crazy and I need you to get out of my life please" would've sufficed.

To be fair, I did do the same thing that got her fucking me, "definitely don't fuck bff guy", so I was kinda just waiting around for it to happen.

In my industry, we call that shit "unit tests".

Anyway.

I'm not super happy about the whole cheating thing, but sometimes life kicks you in the balls and it is what it is.

Let's talk about this "best friend" real quick. Druggie, dumbass, ball-dragging best friend of mine had already slept with one of my prior "girlfriends" (I use this term losely, it was more like FWB but whatever whatever semantics). I stuck around thinking he was just going through a rough time and giving him the benefit of the doubt. 

Shame on me.

I stuck around for a month after "stick my dick in anything" fucks my gf for the second time, because, fuck it, right? I'm done anyway, lets see how long this asshole lasts before he finally admits it.

After about 1 month, he cracks.

I wasn't super happy, but ya know its fine, we'll get through it ðŸ™‚.

I went to his obsessive ex, told her the story very distraught and getting very drunk, went to a party he was at, hugged him, and she came from behind like WWE Smackdown (allegedly) and beat the hell out of him. (I didn't witness it but that's what I've heard).

Totally tried to fuck her too.

It's good stuff.

Onward and upward.

So, I'm pretty angry, annoyed, distraught and such. I detail with her my bedroom troubles with the good ol' wang-jangler and she recounts a story of a pedo in her town getting caught with cp in his basement.

Let's keep that lil tidbit in the memory bank for a hot sec.

---

### Part 5: The Plan.
At this point, I drop out of my Masters, and get pretty fucking depressed. I isolate in my room for about two months thinking of all the ways I'd like to kill everyone who just fucked me over (I didn't and won't kill anyone, but it is nice to fantisize sometimes. Don't tell me you haven't.). After about 1 month, I try to think of the best way to die, and what do you know: I have the best idea ever.

I download government-sanctioned child porn directly onto my Windows 11 computer. (As I knew at the time), the US Government is the largest collector and distributor of child porn that has ever existed (I hope that's not just some bs I read on the internet), and most of the websites on Tor at this point (outside of a few) are FBI honeypots. It's interesting to think that this shit is legal.

Are we the bad guys?

*Anyway*.

Nobody catches me...?

On a side note, I thought that Microsoft, one of the largest companies in the United States of America who frequently works with the US Federal government, would've actually had this shit down to a science, but who knows what bullshit goes on behind the scenes at this point to delay my personally genius and foolproof suicide.

*sarcasm is a sharp and often satirical or ironic utterance designed to cut or give pain*

After about a month (see, I figured someone would figure this shit out, but apparently it never happened), I go outside, talk to people, apologize to some others, give middle fingers, and finally, D-Day comes.

---

### Part 6: The Infiltration.
I go back to Ed-Tech company (and conveniently another company just to piss them off a lil more. As it turns out I'm very good at pissing people off.) and offer to finish up some loose ends which I so abruptly left after, ya know, whatever the fuck that was happened.

I show my boss that I'm interviewing with a company. He didn't know it was for a senior position.

I thought that was funny. He got the joke way too late.

Finally, we get some cybersecurity software on this baby (lol) to find this CP in all its government sanctioned glory.

They find it.

They look at it.

They ponder it.

They think a lil.

They talk about what to do.

...

"Eh."

***I'm sorry, what the fuck do you mean eh?***

I'm losing my fucking mind. These lizards not only couldn't give two fucks, but also *after knowing that I have CP on my computer offer me a fucking job*.

*These lizards not only couldn't give two fucks, but also after knowing that I have CP on my computer offer me a fucking job*.

***These lizards not only couldn't give two fucks, but also after knowing that I have CP on my computer offer me a fucking job***.

Call this what you want, but I think they were waiting to be able to blackmail me as evidenced by some of the other shit in this repo. I don't know, but still, what the fuck.

It's either that, or they actually went directly to the police. I hope this is the case. It's still pretty bullshit that I'm still able to fuck around though. Regardless.

See, I go home, final goodbyes to family and such, say "I should go to jail", get brought to a hospital because they're like "what the fuck", and ***I still don't go to jail.***

***What the fuck.***

So, at this point, I'm actually starting to have some resembelance of fun. They bring some people who I *hope* were criminal investigators to the hospital to figure out if I'm actually a pedo or whatever, I go to a rehab with all these motherfuckers thinking I want to fuck kids, get out, and *I'm still not in jail*.

I receive an oddly threatening email from my last boss, and ***I'm still not in jail.***

I do it again (this time with AI because I don't want to look at real kids getting fucked, go fuck yourselves I don't want to fuck kids), and ***I'm still not in jail.***

Did these motherfuckers want me to be the next Epstein or something?

I will repeat, ***what the fuck.***

---

### Part 7: Welcome to Hell.
So now all these motherfuckers start talking in code to me. Call me schizo or whatever, idc I have evidence *in this repo* with the overhead "talking in code bs" that happens around these parts anymore.

It's taken from my old job because they were the only ones dumb enough to put it in writing. It's an old report, hopefully they don't get too mad at me for releasing it after, idk destroying my reputation and such. Sorry, it's called "Hard Abotting" I guess. They'll get over it.

Random ass people start making fun of me, some of which actually starts to hit my ego. It's a sad state of affairs for a narcissist or whatever the leading hypothesis for this shitshow is at this point.

I mean, just to emphasize how crazy this shit is at this point, *they think that calling me a narcissist is so incredibly degrading my ego*. If you didn't realize it already, *I've been called much worse*.

*People start making playlists about me being a pedo and I'm still not in jail.*

Idk what to tell ya folks. Welcome to the world we live in today I guess.

And my crazy fucking ex still says that I don't think I'm in the wrong for *anything*.

It's a very interesting state of affairs to say the least.

I'll give you one last hint about the strategy at this point: *I'm pissing you off on purpose. You won't, can't, or are waiting patiently to send me to jail, and I find this all very amusing.*

Jokes on me, jokes on you, cutting through the bullshit, in my humble opinion, everyone sucks here.

---

### Part 8: Sooooo........?
*I've admitted to downloading CP. I've admitted to harassment. I've told you I should be in jail. You still haven't done anything.* 

*What the everloving fuck are we doing here?*

Idk what, why, how I'm still sticking around at this point. Some call it a miracle, I call it crazier than my ex. Maybe, I should call it crazier than me. Maybe, the crazier shit is the more it starts to make sense. Maybe, (oh dear god not this egalitarian hoving-over-everyone bullshit again).

If I don't fucking off myself, just take my word of advice and just like... do better I guess?

Like, with all due respect, if I wasn't so fucking lazy I could've actually done some harm at this point.

With all this being said, I was wrong and am wrong for a lot of the shit I've pulled.

*I'm sorry?*

***I'm totally not sorry, and also sorry doesn't mean or do anything so get over it.***

---

### Part 9: Final Thoughts
I don't know. What the fuck?

I guess in my fucked-up version of reality, bad people go to prison.

I was pretty cringe. This whole situtation is pretty cringe. I fell in love with a pornstar. *You still haven't thrown me in a cell.*

I'm pretty sure I'm crazy. You probably think I'm insane. I couldn't give two shits.

Also, at some point, I think people thought I was Jewish. I apologize for any confusion surrounding this matter; I was adopted. I have no fucking idea what I am. I have a big nose and curly hair, I think have some Pole in me, and that's all I'm going off of. So, as far as I'm concerned: Jew it is.

Sincerest apologies.

God *forbid* someone calls me George fucking Santos at this point.

I'm sure some of this story is inaccurate, or possibly even out of touch with reality.

My apologies. It's been a rough couple years, wouldn't ya know. Changes the way you think about things.

This all seemed, I don't know, a little overboard, don't you think? You *have* my playlists.

I don't know, fuck it.

Here's all the information that I have. Welcome to Open Source Software.

Feast, motherfuckers.

P.S.: I'm pretty sure I lost the video of an 'Ashish' weeping, *presumably* for Narcissus. Oh well. I really enjoyed it, and if you were me you would too.

### Part 10.5: Final Word(s)
They're turning the fucking frogs gay, you know it, the CIA is a scam, they're hiding aliens from us, we're the bad guys, Trump did nothing wrong, Biden is a lizard, CIA killed MLK *and* JFK.

No, this is not sarcasm, this is 100% my unadulterated, unyielding thought of reality, 100%. ðŸ™‚

I blame my mom. I don't know why, I just like to do that sometimes. 

She called me Lucifer growing up. That's not very nice.

It's *strangely* accurate. Rose from the sea, mortal wound, false god stuff, idk bro the Bible is looking pretty fuckin submissive and breedable at this point ðŸ«¦.

I'm sorry to disappoint anyone who thought I could do better.

Welcome to Hollywood, Vegas, Spring Boot, Tiger Beetle, or whatever nickname you prefer. I prefer Old Loki, but giving yourself a nickname is pretty lame.

How do you fix a cores issue?

Not to disappoint, but I don't think I have ADHD. There's *way* too many other confounding factors at this point to definitively say I have anything. But, if I do, shame on the overbearing self-proclaimed genius nurse psychologist mother who didn't do anything about it.

When she had a miscarriage, they got her a kid as opposed to a dog. It turns out that was the *wrong move*.

I totally beat the hell out of her. She did threaten to ruin my Dad's life, the Dad who never layed a finger on her. I hope she dies alone and in pain. WHOOPS didn't mean to say that one out loud. Did lucie accidentally let out a lil widdle bit of the tooth? 

[We'll be right back.](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/eE2E1Aldpbk)

See you fucks in hell.
